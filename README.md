# 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model that enables users to check whether they have lung cancer or not based on input data. After the analysis, the user can also download a detailed report summarizing the results, making it easier for patients and doctors to review the diagnosis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- [Add your libraries here, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, pandas, numpy]

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jannatul-Ferdous-Esha/Lung-cancer-Detection.git
   cd Lung-cancer-Detection
